## How to Set Up Devices with Pilot Supertel URC2002 P?
 
To set up devices with Pilot Supertel URC2002 P, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Find the code of the device that you want to control in the device code list that comes with the remote control. If you don't have the list, you can download it from [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/234796577/URC2002-P-Universal-Remote-Control).
2. Press and hold the [SET] key and then press the device key that you want to control, such as [TV1], [VCR1], or [AUX]. The LED will turn on. Release the keys.
3. Enter the three-digit device code. If the code is correct, the LED will turn off. If the code is incorrect, the LED will blink twice and stay on. Try another code in the same brand.
4. Test if the keys on the remote control work or not. If most keys work improperly, try another code in the same brand until you find the best one.

## How to Search for Codes with Pilot Supertel URC2002 P?
 
If you can't find the code of your device in the device code list, or if your device still doesn't work after setting up several times, you can use the quick search function to find out the correct code. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Power on the device that you want to control. If it is a VCR, it must have a tape inserted.
2. Press and hold the [SET] key and then press the device key that you want to control, such as [TV1], [VCR1], or [AUX]. The LED will turn on. Release the keys.
3. Press the [SET] key again and release it. The remote control will enter into quick search mode and the LED will keep flashing.
4. Point the remote control to the device and press [POWER] key. If it is a VCR or AUX, you can press either [POWER] key or [PLAY] key. See if the device works or not (power off or play). If it works, go to step 5. If not, repeat step 4.
5. Check if other keys such as [CH+/-], [VOL+/-], or [MENU] work or not. If they work well enough, press [SET] key to save the code. The LED will blink twice and turn off. If they don't work well enough, press [POWER] key or [PLAY] key again to continue searching.
