In this article, we will show you how to download and use Office 2010 Toolkit 2.2.3 to activate Microsoft Office 2010 for free.
 
## Step 1: Download Office 2010 Toolkit 2.2.3
 
You can download Office 2010 Toolkit 2.2.3 from the developer's website[^1^] or from Google Docs[^2^]. The file size is about 25 MB and it is a zip archive that contains the executable file and some other files. You need to extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Run Office 2010 Toolkit 2.2.3
 
After extracting the zip file, you will see a file named Office 2010 Toolkit.exe or OTK2010.exe in the folder. You need to run this file as an administrator by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run as administrator". You may see a warning message from your antivirus software or Windows Defender, but you can ignore it as the tool is safe and virus-free.
 
Once you run the tool, you will see a window with several tabs and buttons. The main tab is "Main", where you can see the information about your Office 2010 installation and activation status.
 
## Step 3: Choose an Activation Method
 
There are two methods to activate Office 2010 with Office 2010 Toolkit 2.2.3: KMS and EZ-Activator. You can choose either one depending on your preference.
 
KMS is a service that runs on a server and provides activation for multiple clients using a single key. It requires an internet connection and renews the activation every 180 days. EZ-Activator is a simpler method that uses a script to emulate the KMS server on your computer and activate Office 2010 permanently offline.
 
To use KMS, you need to click on the "Activation" tab and then click on the "Activate" button under "Office Activation". To use EZ-Activator, you need to click on the "EZ-Activator" button under "Office Activation". The tool will automatically detect your Office version and edition and apply the appropriate activation method.
