## What is FIAT ePER?
 
FIAT ePER is an acronym for Electronic Parts Catalogue. It is an online database that contains detailed information about all the spare parts and accessories for FIAT vehicles, including Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Abarth, and Fiat Professional[^1^]. FIAT ePER covers all models and versions of FIAT vehicles from 1986 to present[^2^]. You can access FIAT ePER from any device with an Internet connection and a web browser[^1^].
 
## How to Access FIAT ePER?
 
There are two ways to access FIAT ePER online parts catalogue: through the official website of FIAT or through third-party websites that host FIAT ePER. The official website of FIAT is [https://www.pekidi.com/navi?FORCED=TRUE](https://www.pekidi.com/navi?FORCED=TRUE) [^1^]. This website requires you to select your language, country, and drive (left or right) before you can enter the catalogue[^1^]. The advantage of using the official website is that it is always updated with the latest data and features[^1^]. However, the official website may not be available in some countries or regions due to licensing issues[^2^].
 
The alternative way to access FIAT ePER online parts catalogue is through third-party websites that host FIAT ePER. These websites are usually run by FIAT enthusiasts or forums that provide FIAT ePER as a service for their members or visitors[^2^] [^4^]. For example, one of the most popular third-party websites that host FIAT ePER is [http://eper.fiatforum.com/](http://eper.fiatforum.com/) [^2^], which is run by The FIAT Forum. The advantage of using third-party websites is that they may be more accessible and user-friendly than the official website[^2^]. However, the disadvantage is that they may not be updated with the latest data and features, and they may contain errors or inaccuracies[^2^]. Therefore, you should always verify the information you get from third-party websites with the official website or your local dealer shop before ordering any parts.

For example, if you search by VIN, you will need to enter your 17-digit VIN code that identifies your specific vehicle[^1^] [^2^]. If you search by Model-Chassis, you will need to select your vehicle make, model, version, engine type, body type, etc.[^1^] [^2^]. If you search by Part Number, you will need to enter the part number that corresponds to the part you are looking for[^1^] [^2^]. You can also use wildcards (\*) to replace unknown characters in the part number[^1^] [^2^].
