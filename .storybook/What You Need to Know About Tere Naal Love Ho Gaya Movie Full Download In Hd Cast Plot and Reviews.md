- The Times of India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Director Mandeep Kumar cleverly handles the abduction subject in a humorous way against a cultural backdrop of Punjab...Post-marriage, TNLHG is Riteish and Genelia's first film together. And they look good as a pair...TNLHG is one of those movies that you like for 10 minutes and then don't for the next 10. The cycle continues for long. But the climax is fairly engaging and the man who makes it happen is Om Puri."[^1^]
- Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a fresh rating of 100% based on one review and wrote: "Director Mandeep Kumar cleverly handles the abduction subject in a humorous way against a cultural backdrop of Punjab."[^2^]

- Koimoi gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is an entertaining fare with lovely music as its biggest plus point...Watch it for its light moments."[^4^]
- Wogma gave the film a thumbs down rating and wrote: "The moment characters in a film begin reacting to everything by yelling at the top of their voices, I'm put off...That besides, there is nothing much going for it in terms of story or logic."[^5^]
