## What Critics and Audiences Say About Valkyrie
 
Valkyrie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences when it was released in 2008. The film has a 62% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 198 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Given the subject matter, Valkyrie could have been an outstanding historical thriller, but settles for being a mildly entertaining, but disposable yarn.\"
 
Some critics praised the film's suspense, direction, and performances, especially by Cruise and the supporting cast. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing: \"This is a film about veterans of officer rank, with all the reserve and probity that officers gather on the way up. They do not scream or hurry and do not care to be seen that way. They have learned not to panic under fire, and they have never been more under fire than now.\"[^1^]
 
Other critics criticized the film's lack of emotional depth, historical accuracy, and authenticity. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five, writing: \"It's a bit like watching a second world war version of Ocean's Eleven ... Cruise himself is oddly blank and affectless as Stauffenberg; he doesn't give us much idea of his personality or his motivation.\"
 
The film also faced some controversy over its casting, production, and release. Some German politicians and veterans objected to Cruise playing von Stauffenberg because of his affiliation with Scientology, which is considered a cult in Germany. Some historians and critics questioned the film's portrayal of von Stauffenberg and the other plotters as heroes, arguing that they were motivated by self-interest and opportunism rather than moral principles. The film's release date was also delayed several times due to reshoots, editing issues, and marketing challenges.
 
The film grossed $200.3 million worldwide against a budget of $75 million, making it a moderate box office success. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.
