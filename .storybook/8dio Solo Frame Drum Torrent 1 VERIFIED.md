If you are looking for a comprehensive and deep-sampled collection of individual frame drums for your music production, you might want to check out 8dio Solo Frame Drum Torrent 1. This library is a remastered, redesigned and reprogrammed edition of the original Epic Solo Frame Drums by 8dio, which offers over 3,000 samples of solo frame drums, recorded with a variety of mallet types, brushes, hands and fingers. The library also features a built-in articulation browser, an internal step-sequencer, front-face effects, textural convolutions, and the newest 3.4 Chaos Engine.

The library contains four types of frame drums: two styles of Irish BodhrÃ¡n, one African Tar drum, and a North American tribal buffalo hide shamanic drum. Each drum has its own unique sound and character, ranging from the massive low end of the large BodhrÃ¡n to the crisp, sharp ring of the tar drum. The library also covers traditional and extended playing styles and articulations, such as flams, rolls, scrapes, snaps and more.
 
One of the highlights of the library is the internal step-sequencer, which allows you to program the solo frame drums with ultra-precision. You can create advanced rhythms in any signature rhythm and with velocity layering and round-robins. You can also choose the tempo and even play in triplets. The step-sequencer also syncs to your host tempo automatically, making it easy to match any project.
 
Another feature that adds to the versatility of the library is the front-face effects and textural convolutions. You can apply various effects such as EQ, compression, distortion, delay and reverb to shape the sound of the solo frame drums. You can also use the textural convolutions to add atmospheric and ambient layers to your percussion tracks.
 
The library is designed to work in conjunction with the Epic Frame Drum Ensemble library by 8dio, which is focused on capturing the big sound of ensemble frame drums. The two libraries complement each other well, as the solo frame drums cover some of the more intimate and deep sounds, while the ensemble frame drums cover that brutal, big, bad-ass sound used in epic scores.
 
8dio Solo Frame Drum Torrent 1 is a great library for anyone who wants to add some realistic and expressive solo frame drums to their music. The library offers a wide range of sounds and articulations, as well as a powerful sequencer and effects system. The library is compatible with Kontakt VST / AU / AAX and requires Kontakt 5.8.1 Full Retail (or later) to run.
