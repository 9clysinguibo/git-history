### What is Nil Battey Sannata about?
 
Nil Battey Sannata, which means "zero divided by zero" or "nothing", is a colloquial term used in India to describe someone who is good for nothing or hopeless. The film uses this term as a metaphor for the lack of opportunities and aspirations among the poor and uneducated sections of society.
 
The film follows the journey of Chanda Sahay, a widowed mother who works as a maid, a factory worker and a part-time tutor to make ends meet. She lives in a small house in Agra with her 15-year-old daughter Apeksha, who goes by the nickname Appu. Chanda wants Appu to study hard and become an IAS officer, a prestigious government job in India. However, Appu has no interest in academics and hates mathematics. She believes that she is destined to be a maid like her mother and mocks her mother's dreams.
 
Chanda is worried that Appu will fail her Class 10 board exams and ruin her future. She seeks advice from her employer Dr. Diwan, played by Ratna Pathak Shah, who runs a hospital and a school. Dr. Diwan suggests that Chanda should join Appu's school as a student and sit with her in the same class. She offers to pay for Chanda's fees and books. Chanda agrees to this unconventional idea and enrols in Appu's school as a Class 10 student.
 
Appu is shocked and embarrassed by her mother's decision and tries to dissuade her from attending school. She feels that her mother is competing with her and trying to prove her wrong. Chanda, on the other hand, is determined to motivate Appu and show her that nothing is impossible if one works hard. She also develops a friendship with her maths teacher Shrivastava, played by Pankaj Tripathi, who helps her overcome her fear of numbers.
 
The film depicts the struggles and joys of Chanda and Appu as they navigate their roles as mother-daughter, classmates and friends. It also showcases the importance of education, self-confidence and family support in achieving one's goals.
